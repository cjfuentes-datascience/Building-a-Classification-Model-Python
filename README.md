# Building-a-Classification-Model-Python

This project demonstrates how to build a simple machine learning model in Python using the scikit-learn package. The model is a classification model used to classify Iris flowers using the random forest algorithm. The project includes the following steps: 
- importing necessary libraries and modules
- adding the Iris dataset
- splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- defining the model and its parameters
- training the model
- testing the model and evaluating its performance
- using the trained model to make predictions on new data
